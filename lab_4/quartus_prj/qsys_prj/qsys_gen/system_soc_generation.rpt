Warning: system_soc.hps_0: "Configuration/HPS-to-FPGA user 0 clock frequency" (desired_cfg_clk_mhz) requested 100.0 MHz, but only achieved 97.368421 MHz
Warning: system_soc.hps_0: "QSPI clock frequency" (desired_qspi_clk_mhz) requested 400.0 MHz, but only achieved 370.0 MHz
Warning: system_soc.hps_0: 1 or more output clock frequencies cannot be achieved precisely, consider revising desired output clock frequencies.
Info: system_soc.hps_0: ECC will be enabled in the preloader because an interface width of 24 or 40 has been chosen.
